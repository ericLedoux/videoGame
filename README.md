# My Video Game!
My goals with this game are to:
- Learn the basics of python and pygame 
- Make a game that is simple and fun
- Feel like I did something today
  
## Description
The game is an arcade-styled experience that has you gunning for as many points as possible in a 60-second timespan.  You have to
be careful not to run into the red blocks though, as they'll end your run!
