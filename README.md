# My Video Game!
My goals in this game are to:
- Have a functioning menu system that first shows a main menu that has a start and quit button, and then a level select sub-menu
- Within the levels, have a grid system that lets me place specific tile classes that do different things
- Make sprites for the player, animations, background, ect.
  
## Description
The final game's topic and gameplay style are still in question, but I've currently settled on a puzzle-platformer where you walk through one side of the screen and appear on the other like in Pac-Man.  Most likely a small number of levels, somewhere around the 6-10 range ideally.
  
## Getting started
  
### Dependencies
- Use Python and pygame ya goof!
  
### Installing
- I haven't the foggiest since the game doesn't, well, exist yet so you might have to wait on this one.
  
### Executing Program
- Good luck, since there is no program yet.
  
## Help
- Second verse, same as the first.
